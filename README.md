# JAMStack personal blog

This is my side-project where I created a personal blog site using **JAMStack** architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

I also used **Eleventy** and **Netlify CMS** to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files
